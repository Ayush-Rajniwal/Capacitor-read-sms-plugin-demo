## How to use
- Clone this repo.
- Also, clone the [read-sms](https://github.com/Ayush-Rajniwal/read-sms) repo (this is the Plugin repo. Currently it is not published on npm so you have to install it locally).

-  Install the plugin from your local env
    - ```npm install ../read-sms``` (assuming the read-sms is just one directory above this repo).
- ```npm install```
- ```ionic cap sync```
- ```npx cap open android```
- Run it on emulator or read device using android studio.
